  <h4 style="text-align: center;"> ꧁༒☬ Our little cafe has been opened since 2009 and has grown ever since. We started as just a cafe where people could come to be warmed by our sweet tasting coffee. But we had recently had been closed down due to early lockdowns, due to the virus. We had almost completly lost hope and we had actually thought of closing down for good. But our founder's son Eskil Målfrid told us not to lose hope, and if we thought of closing down we might as well help the community around us get through this hard time. So we did. We worked at local food stations, helped food drives devolp and helped build our communtity through its hard times. And because of our hard work we had actually gained customers because of our past good deeds. We decided to help our neighborhood in its own hard times and it helped us in our time in need. We have to give thanks to all our fellow community helpers and customers for helping us stay in business so as a fellow thank we, we have decided to have a complete reopening and have grown every since. We decided to sell not only our best coffee but our greatest coffee as well as products and merchinese to help us grow. Thank you for visting 'Cozy Corner' and we hope that your coffee is as cozy as our community. Thank you! - 'Cozy Corner' bean Cafe ☬༒꧂ </h4>
  <h2> ꧁༒☬ We aim to keep opening locations and to keep helping our local community as it has help us! ☬༒꧂</h2>
